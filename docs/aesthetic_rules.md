## 1. Classification Tiers

| Tier | Score Range | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Sub 3** | 1.0 - 2.9 | Severe facial underdevelopment, multiple significant failos |
| **Sub 5** | 3.0 - 4.9 | Below average, notable failos affecting overall appearance |
| **Normie** | 5.0 - 5.9 | Average, unremarkable features |
| **HTN** | 6.0 - 6.9 | High-Tier Normie, some attractive features |
| **Chadlite** | 7.0 - 7.9 | Attractive, mostly positive features |
| **Chad** | 8.0 - 8.9 | Very attractive, excellent facial harmony |
| **Adam** | 9.0 - 10.0 | Near-perfect facial aesthetics |

## 2. Key Measurements

### 2.1 Canthal Tilt
**Definition**: The angle formed by drawing a line from the inner canthus (corner) to the outer canthus of the eye.

| Value | Classification |
|-------|---------------|
| > +8° | Extreme positive (can look unnatural) |
| +4° to +8° | **Ideal** (hunter eyes) |
| 0° to +4° | Neutral/Slightly positive |
| -4° to 0° | Neutral/Slightly negative |
| < -4° | Negative (tired appearance) |

**Impact**: Positive canthal tilt creates the "hunter eyes" appearance, associated with dominance and attractiveness.

### 2.2 Bigonial to Bizygomatic Width Ratio
**Definition**: The ratio of jaw width (measured at the gonion points) to cheekbone width (measured at the zygion points).

| Ratio | Classification |
|-------|---------------|
| > 85% | Wide jaw (can look blocky) |
| 80-85% | Strong, masculine jaw |
| **75-80%** | **Ideal** (defined but harmonious) |
| 70-75% | Slightly narrow jaw |
| < 70% | Narrow jaw (V-shaped face) |

**Impact**: This ratio determines the perceived strength of the jawline relative to facial width.

---

### 2.3 Gonial Angle
**Definition**: The angle formed at the gonion (jaw angle point) between the ramus (ascending part of mandible) and the body of the mandible.

| Angle | Classification |
|-------|---------------|
| < 115° | Very acute (extremely strong jaw) |
| 115-120° | Acute (very strong jaw) |
| **125-130°** | **Ideal** (masculine, well-developed) |
| 130-140° | Slightly obtuse |
| > 140° | Obtuse (weak jaw development) |

**Impact**: Lower gonial angles are associated with stronger, more masculine jaws. Very low angles can indicate jaw surgery or exceptional genetics.

---

### 2.4 Midface Ratio
**Definition**: The distance from the pupils to the upper lip divided by the total face height.

| Ratio | Classification |
|-------|---------------|
| < 40% | Short midface (can look childlike) |
| 40-42% | Slightly short |
| **43-44%** | **Ideal** (Golden Ratio) |
| 45-47% | Slightly long |
| > 47% | Long midface (ages the face) |

**Impact**: The midface ratio significantly affects perceived age and attractiveness. A slightly shorter midface is generally more youthful.

---

### 2.5 Nasofrontal Angle
**Definition**: The angle formed at the nasion (bridge of the nose) between the glabella (forehead) and the nose dorsum.

| Angle | Classification |
|-------|---------------|
| < 120° | Very acute (prominent nose/recessed forehead) |
| 120-130° | Acute |
| **130-135°** | **Ideal** |
| 135-145° | Slightly obtuse |
| > 145° | Obtuse (flat profile) |

**Impact**: This angle affects profile aesthetics and is particularly important in side-view analysis.

---

### 2.6 Facial Thirds
**Definition**: The face divided into three horizontal sections:
- **Upper Third**: Hairline to glabella
- **Middle Third**: Glabella to subnasale (base of nose)
- **Lower Third**: Subnasale to menton (chin)

| Proportion | Classification |
|------------|---------------|
| Equal (33.3% each) | **Ideal** |
| ±3% variation | Acceptable |
| > 5% variation | Noticeable disharmony |

---

### 2.7 Symmetry Score
**Definition**: How closely the left and right sides of the face mirror each other.

| Score | Classification |
|-------|---------------|
| > 95% | **Ideal** (near-perfect) |
| 90-95% | Good symmetry |
| 85-90% | Average |
| 80-85% | Noticeable asymmetry |
| < 80% | Significant asymmetry |

## 3. Orthotropics Principles

### Forward Growth
- Proper tongue posture (mewing) promotes forward facial growth
- Forward growth creates:
  - Higher cheekbones
  - Wider palate
  - Stronger jaw
  - Better canthal tilt

### Signs of Good Development
✅ High cheekbones with hollow underneath
✅ Wide, U-shaped dental arch
✅ Defined jawline with visible gonial angle
✅ Forward-projecting chin
✅ Positive or neutral canthal tilt

### Signs of Underdevelopment
❌ Flat cheekbones
❌ Narrow, V-shaped dental arch
❌ Recessed chin
❌ Long face syndrome
❌ Negative canthal tilt

## 4. Improvement Strategies

### Soft Maxxing (Non-surgical)
- Mewing (proper tongue posture)
- Chewing hard foods (gum, mastic)
- Weight loss (to define facial features)
- Skincare routine
- Posture improvement

### Hard Maxxing (Surgical)
- Rhinoplasty (nose reshaping)
- Genioplasty (chin advancement)
- Jaw implants
- Cheek implants
- Blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery)
- Canthoplasty (canthal tilt correction)
